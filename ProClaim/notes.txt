When deleting a claim: (DONE)
	- currently only admins can delete claims
	- all subclaims are deleted with parent claim
	- all permission records for claim and subclaims are deleted
	- subclaims can be deleted individually
	- delete claim tool requires confirmation click

When abandoning a claim: (DONE)
	- if claim is in a claim group:
		- claim and all subclaims are transfered to admin
		- all claim permissions are removed
		- all subclaim permissions are retained
	- if a claim is not in a subgroup:
		- claim and all subclaims are deleted
		- all claim permissions are removed
		- all subclaim permissions are removed

when transferring a claim:
	- if claim is in a claim group
		- check that new owner is not exceeding group limit; cancel transfer if so
		- remove all claim permissions
		- keep subclaim permissions, send new owner message informing of subclaims
	- if claim is not in a claim group:
		- remove all claim permissions
		- keep subclaim permissions, send new owner message informing of subclaims

Still to do before release:

- make vault optional

- make sure permission records are removed when a claim is deleted, abandoned or transferred
	- done for delete, all permissions removed for claim and subclaims
	- done for abandon, all permissions removed for claim and subclaims
	- when transferring a claim to a new owner:
		- remove all permissions for claim 
		- subclaims?
			- options:
				- leave all permissions in place 
					- new owner may not realize permissions exist on subclaims.
						- perhaps output message if subclaims exist?
				- remove all permissions
					- lease holder's will have permissions revoked
				- remove all permissions except managers
				- remove all subclaims

- consider implementing bukkit permission groups by generating group UUID's on startup
	- bukkit permission groups can be discovered using vault
	
- revisit claim.getClaimPermissionMap(), there may be some optimization possible there

- move claim resize method out of claim tool class. make claims self-resizing: claim.resize(loc1,loc2)

- handle abandoning/deleting subclaims - Done, except #4 below.
    - subclaims are transferred or deleted along with parent when abandon claim command is used
    - subclaims are deleted along with parent when delete tool is used.
    - subclaims cannot be abandoned, only parent claims.
    - how does a non-admin player remove a subclaim?
    	- give access to delete tool to regular players
    	
- display remaining claim blocks when appropriate

- fix other messages that need more information

- final tweaks to database tables

- make sure records with foreign keys get deleted or updated (claimgroups, child/parent claims, permissions, etc)

- implement additional datastore types: yaml, mysql, griefprevention

- create a public api
	- simple api that does not require importing classes, to work easily when plugin is a softdepend
		- boolean hasBuildPermissionAt(player,location)
		- boolean hasContainerPermissionAt(player,location)
		- boolean hasAccessPermissionAt(player,location)
		
	- possible complex api that does import classes, gives more access to methods/objects
		- allow creating/removing claims, modifying permissions
	
- fix: no resize on corner click when using delete tool - DONE, I think

things that can wait until after release:

- worldguard integration - DONE!! (mostly)
- don't allow claims to overlap worldguard regions, unless player has build permission in wg region - DONE!!!
- dynmap integration - done, with WorldGuard regions at least. not my ideal choice
- move caches into datastore - DONE
- player cache pruning
- rewrite visualizations


Subclaim rules:
when creating, first click must be within a claim owned by player (or an admin may also create within a claim)
when creating, second click must be within same claim, not overlapping other subclaims
only claim owners or admins can create subclaims
only claim owners or admins can delete subclaims
subclaims can not be transferred. send error message stating only top level claims may be transferred
subclaims can not be abandoned, only deleted?

Decisions to be made:

- How can regular players be allowed to create their own towns with plots for sale?
	- allow setting resizeable on claims
	- allow setting claimgroup on claims - perhaps linked to the WorldGuard region
	- maybe a new 'Town' ProClaim tool - linked to the WorldGuard town region

- How does a non-admin player remove a subclaim?
